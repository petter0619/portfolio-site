# Portfolio Site V1

Site was built using HTML and CSS with a minimal amount of JavaScript for functionality.

The site is hosted using Github Pages on a custom domain. A live demo can be found here: [pettercarlsson.com](http://pettercarlsson.com)

Known "issues":
* The styling for the website only works in modern versions of web browsers. E.g. it does not look right in older versions of Safari.
